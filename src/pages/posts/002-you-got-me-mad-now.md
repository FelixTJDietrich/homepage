Today, four years ago, Billy Herrington, also known as Aniki (Japanese: 兄貴, lit. older brother), passed away in a car accident on March 2, 2018. He has been an inspirational figure in my life. His death had a pivotal impact on my life. In remembrance of this magnificent man, I want to share some strange story of how he, together with other internet phenomena, personally impacted my life. As a warning, this blog post contains internet culture that involves homoerotic content with widely used swearing and vulgarity which might be a bit not safe for work.

## Who is Billy Herrington?

Billy Herrington (July 14, 1969 — March 2, 2018) was an American model and pornographic film actor ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Herrington)). His appearances in various gay pornographic movies led him to become a key figure of the Gachimuchi internet meme ([Know Your Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/people/billy-herrington-gachimuchi)).

On September 30, 2007, a wrestling video clip of one of Billy Herrington’s gay porns called "Workout: Muscle Fantasies 3" (1999) from Can-Am Productions, was uploaded to [Nico Nico Douga (NND)](https://www.nicovideo.jp), a Japanese video-sharing website. The video ["Professional Muscular Pants Wresteling"](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm1175788) quickly gained popularity and became one of the most-watched videos of the website. Amongst other clips, this video soon turned into a popular source for bait-and-switch trolling and evolved into the Gachimuchi subculture.

Gachimuchi (Japanese: ガチムチ, lit. "muscular chubby") or Gachi refers to a large group of musical remixes and comedic edited videos using homoerotic wrestling videos in an entertaining, funny, and creative way. The meme gained popularity especially in Japan, China, Russia, and later in the western-world, mostly through the live streaming platform [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv). There are numerous mashups out there, with at least over 110,000 uploaded videos to YouTube alone so far ([Source](http://honisoit.com/2018/03/the-life-and-death-of-a-pornstar/)).

Billy Herrington embraced the meme. He was appreciative and honored by the amount of work and creativity it took to create gachi remixes. He interacted a lot with his fans and seemed to me to be a very open-minded, positive, and loving person that cared about each and everyone that he saw struggling.

The following video gives a good summary about Billy Herrington and gachimuchi focused towards Twitch. It contains censored muscular men and lots of Twitch memes. It goes more in-depth and also shows some examples of gachimuchi, but it might be a bit hard to understand and confusing:

## The Bajs and Gachimuchi

I experienced gachimuchi mostly through Twitch, where I spent a significant amount of time on between 2014 and 2020. I'm kind of a Twitch historian for that era. My favorite streamers to watch were Forsen and Reckful, which I started watching shortly after the video game Hearthstone (2014) came out.

Forsen’s community called the "Forsen Boys", "Forsen Bajs", or just "Bjas", are arguably the most influential community on Twitch culture. The most entertaining part of Forsen’s stream isn’t him, it’s his chat, the bajs. They are the meme incubator of Twitch who create, spread, and evolve memes.

Around late 2014, early 2015, Forsen started using the music streaming service [plug.dj](http://plug.dj) for letting Twitch chat be the DJ of his stream. They could enqueue any YouTube video to be used as background audio. People started using it to enqueue music, meme videos, "cancer" or also "earrape" music, soon followed by the first gachi remixes. And thus, gachimuchi was introduced, amplified, and spread not only to his stream but also across the whole of mainstream Twitch.

I have fond memories of just listening to gachi music all day. I would listen to it even on my own, also when going on walks with my dogs. It is strange to explain, the fact that it was so fringe and impossible to explain to most people made it strangly enjoyable to me. It was kind of my own thing that I only enjoyed in secret with people on Twitch and the internet. I had this strong sense of belonging to the people online, which made me all the more disconnected with people offline.


## Gachi vs. Anime

**Disclaimer:** The sentiments towards gachimuchi and anime in this section are a bit subjective.

Two of the biggest communities inside Twitch chat are gachimuchi fans and anime fans. Anime fans or fans of the Japanese culture are also often referred to as weebs ([Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Weeb)). Both fanbases have been in a bit of a war inside of chat. Each wanting to show superiority over the other side by drowning out the other's spam or making jokes about each other.

Weebs have been generally looked down upon on the internet which is also reflected in Twitch chat. People like to express their disgust and annoyance towards weebs and also often associate them with pedophilia. Weebs have often been considered degenerates or losers. In recent years though, anime has become more mainstream and this sentiment got a bit more neutral. Anime and liking anime is not considered that weird any more.

Gachimuchi also originated from Japan and is therefore arguably a bit weeb. There is a lot of homophobia on the internet and some people see gachi only as a funny gay joke, but gachimuchi is not about being homophobic. The fanbase likes to make homoerotic jokes but not in a homophobic way. Gachi is not gay, it's manly and has some deeper messages.

After Billy's passing, the two fanbases seemed to be more in peace with each other, stating that Billy did not want us to fight.

The following Reddit comment sums up pretty well the message behind gachimuchi in reply to a gachi vs. anime post: *(Warning: Edgy language!)*

## My History with Anime

I had my first anime phase when I was around 12 years old. For a short while, I watched a lot of anime on my iPod Touch around 2009. I remember watching anime like Death Note (2006), Elfen Lied (2004), Vampire Knight (2008), and also much weirder anime. I was super hooked, enjoyed it a lot, and basically watched anime all day outside of school. I liked anime.

One day at school, a friend pointed out in front of class: "Listen guys, Felix is watching weird anime stuff". I felt ashamed and exposed, I did not want to get bullied like others. I instantly stopped watching anime. I’m not a weird kid, I want to fit in. I hate anime now. People that watch anime are weird and looked down upon. At least that’s how I felt for a long time after that incident.

My sentiment of disliking anime, and the weirdos who watch it, got carried on until I was about 19, around 2017. I rewatched Avatar the Last Airbender (2005), a show I always liked to watch on Nickelodeon as a child, arguably not anime. Then I watched its spin-off: The Legend of Korra (2012). I was wondering if there are similar shows out there and found the anime Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood (2009). I watched its 64 episodes in 3 days... I enjoyed it even though it’s anime. Still, I was opposed to watching anime, but I was bored. A good friend had mentioned Attack on Titan (2013). I watched the first episode. I watched the second episode. I watched the rest of season two (2017). I got hooked again. I watched the next anime. And the next. Thus, my second anime phase had begun.

Opinions of other ignorant people destroyed this medium for me initially. I really began to like anime again and felt really stupid for letting other people compromise my interests and self. I felt ignorant myself because I also carried around this negative sentiment for people who like anime for too long. Same holds for other things as well, I realized that I'm ignorant, early 2018.


## You got me mad now - 歪みねぇな！

One of Billy Herrington's phrases that resonated with me the most is "Yugami nee na" 「歪みねぇな」. This phrase comes from a mishearing ([Soramimi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soramimi)) of the phrase "You got me mad now" of the original Professional Muscular Pants Wrestling video (NND Video: [本格的 ガチムチパンツレスリング](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm1175788) skip to 7:49). "Yugami nee na" teaches us: one cannot attain one's goals when distortion and hatred towards others misleads you so ([Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/forsen/comments/mrddyb/comment/gulv3ok/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)).

Billy also talks about living a life of *yugami nee na*. Here is for example my favorite quote:
<div class="videoWrapper">

> "I want to tell my fans at Nico Nico to live their life without any judgements and be adventurous. When opportunity comes, put work into your faith and don't be afraid to go out and live life. Whatever your sexuality is, gay, straight, boy, girl, go have fun. That's what life is all about. And live a life of yugami nee na."  
> \- Billy Herrington, boss of the gym

## Billy's Death

I received the news of his death while waiting for a train for a long journey home. I felt at disbelieve and genuinely sad. It was so sudden and out of nowhere. This was the first time where I really realized that life could just end, today.

On my way back and the following days, I reflected a lot about life and got strangely motivated to change my way of living. I thought about what would Aniki want for me and how I could become like him.

I was a self-hating anime fan now and I had felt some mindless hatred against more "degenerate" anime fans, as in people who even study Japanese to watch anime without dubs or subs. Angry about my ignorance I decided, that I wanted to take the ultimate step for me to overcome this ignorance and the fist step towards radical self-acceptance: I started seriously studying Japanese.

## Conclusion

Billy Herrington was a magnificent man who taught me a lot of important lessons that I can not even put into words. Gachimuchi and Twitch was such an integral part of my enjoyment in life at that time, and the community behind it gave me a place where I could belong. I'm really grateful for that time.

I'm trying to live a life of *yugami nee na* and have reflected on Aniki's passing every year so far. With each year I'm getting madder and madder, accepting myself more, doing less people pleasing, and being more comfortable and confident in being myself. I have come a long way with self growth but I still have a lot to learn about the teachings of gachimuchi.

It has been a journey.

Sleep tight, Aniki.
