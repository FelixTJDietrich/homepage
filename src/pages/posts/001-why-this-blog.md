Self-improvement is the main reason for starting this blog. I’m trying to improve and grow as a person and I’m prepared to face myself and my inexperiences.

For most of my life so far I have lived a very reclusive life. As a teenager, I thought of myself as just an observer paying witness to the world events without disturbing them until I die. An alien amongst man. I barely talked to people and shared almost nothing with no one. My mind was my own, a fort only there for my own amusement, where nobody is allowed to enter. In high school my nickname was "Superman" because people noticed how low-key I tried to be while probably leading a secret superhero life.

A lot of things changed for the better since then. I'm no longer overprotective of my mind. Others are allowed read- and write-access to it. I feel more in command of its access control. I have become a more social person now, wanting to connect with more and more people.

Starting a blog and leaving traces on the internet would have been unimaginable by my younger self, out of fear, shame, anxiety, and indifference. I like challenging myself and I hope that this blog helps me improve in many areas of life.

## The epiphany

I was continuing to work on New Year's reflections and resolutions on 1st of January this year and came across the book: ["Show Your Work!" by Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/).

My New Year's resolutions were already focused on connecting with more people and friends around me and being more social in general. After reading the title of the book and getting more familiar with its content, it became clear to me that I wanted to start showing my work and connect with people doing so.

A blog in combination with a social media presence where I show off my work feels like a good project for the years to come. It would involve a lot of benefits both personally and professionally with plenty of growth potential. A million birds with one stone, a no-brainer for me. So I sat down and started getting to work.

## My reasons

As already said, the main reason is self-improvement.

A blog seems to me the next major step in my self-improvement journey. It will help me solve a lot of issues and challenges I'm experiencing in life.

### Overcoming perfectionism

I suffer from perfectionism and I’m trying to work on it.

Perfectionism has its perks but often gets in the way of life. It made me a very reserved person. I would not attempt something because I might fail or worse, some people might see me fail. Such pain was intolerable by me.

Mistakes cause me a lot of suffering. Making a public mistake and being seen as anything other than perfect led me to avoid life. This avoidance caused inexperienced, which in turn led to avoidance in a negative feedback loop. You can't be perfect from the get-go. Practice makes perfect, and failure leads to learning.

Perfectionism gets in the way of learning and accomplishing. With a blog I’d become more comfortable with failing and making mistakes publicly.

### Reducing shame

Shame rules my life.

This emotion is also closely connected to perfectionism for me. I used to hide from others and not share anything about myself out of shame. Things I'm shameful about are often not really things I should be ashamed of rationally.

When I used commute by train for example, I would just sit there in silence for over an hour looking out of the window just thinking. Because that was all I was comfortable doing. I wouldn't listen to music because sound might leak out, or do something on my phone because someone might see what I was doing. I was strangely secretive about the weirdest things. Almost everything was a cause of shame for me in public and I only felt at ease in private on my own.

I have come a long way with managing shame but there are still ways to go. I want to become more comfortable sharing my "shameful" self. A blog is a drastic measure in that regard.

### Challenging indifference

Intense amount of shame and avoidance caused indifference for me.

If you have needs, wants, and desires but can't attain them, one way of coping is indifference. I was growing pretty apathetic to life and had trouble getting interested in most things. As a result of this, I became bored and spent most of my time distracting myself and stopped being curious.

It is easier to be apathetic to something you can not get then going through the pain of wanting it.

I’m more balanced now but still struggle with my fair share of apathy and finding curiosity. This blog should help me get more interested and mindful about my interests again.

### Connecting with others

I have been an inactive node in the social graph of society. Information that reached me through the network would not propagate any further. I want to change that.

In the past years, I have met people that I like and started wanting to discover more of them. I was socially deprived for too long, now is my time to make up for it. There are likeminded people out there, I just have to find them. I’m more comfortable with myself now and talking to people has become bearable and enjoyable for me, at least more often than not.

Last year felt like I was learning exponentially more things because of the connections I made. I want to learn new things, connect with more people, make new friends, and experience new things. A blog will help with that. I want to become an active node in the social graph.

### Million other reasons

There are obviously a lot more reasons I could list such as: improving my writing, building a brand, documenting life, keeping busy, helping others, learning self-expression, getting thoughts straight, and so on...

A lot of reasons and benefits will reveal themselves in the future. I can not fully asses the hidden value this blog. I have started placing a lot of weight on the unknown and only time will tell its value to me.

## Conclusion

I’m starting a blog.

I have yet to fully decide how much I’m sharing and what. There is a tentative list of topics in my head: mental health, experiences, projects, tools, books, interests, and so on...

I’m exited about the outcome of my blog experiment and hope that you could get some insights into why I’m starting this blog.
