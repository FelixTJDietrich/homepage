Self-improvement is the main reason for starting this blog. I'm trying to improve and grow as a person, prepared to face myself and my inexperience.

For most of my life so far, I have lived a very reclusive life. As a teenager, I thought of myself as just an alien observer paying witness to the world events without disturbing them until death. I barely talked to people and shared almost nothing with no one. My mind was my own, a fort only there for my taking, where nobody is allowed to enter. I was nicknamed "Superman" in high school because people noticed how low-key I tried to be while probably leading a secret superhero life.

A lot of things have changed for the better since then. I'm no longer overprotective of my mind. Others are allowed read- and write-access to it. I feel more in command of its access control. I have become a more social person now, wanting to connect with more and more people.

Starting a blog and leaving traces on the internet would have been unimaginable by my younger self, out of fear, shame, anxiety, and indifference. I like challenging myself and hope that this blog helps me improve in many areas of life.

## The epiphany

I was continuing to work on New Year's reflections and resolutions on the 1st of January this year and came across the book: ["Show Your Work!" by Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/).

My New Year's resolutions already focused on connecting with more people and friends around me, and being more social in general. After reading the book's title and getting more familiar with its content, it became clear that I want to start showing my work and connect with people doing so.

A blog in combination with a social media presence where I show off my work feels like a good project for the years to come. It would involve a lot of benefits both personally and professionally with plenty of growth potential. A million birds with one stone. A no-brainer. So I sat down and started getting to work.

## My reasons

As already said, the main reason is self-improvement.

A blog seems to be the next major step in my self-improvement journey. It will help me solve many issues and challenges I'm experiencing in life.

### Overcoming perfectionism

I suffer from perfectionism and I'm trying to work on it.

Perfectionism has its perks but often gets in the way of life. It made me a very reserved person. I would not attempt something because I might fail, or worse, some people might see me fail. Such pain was intolerable for me.

Mistakes cause me a lot of suffering. Making a public mistake and being seen as anything other than perfect led me to avoid life. This avoidance caused inexperience, which led to more avoidance in a negative feedback loop. You can't be perfect from the get-go. Practice makes perfect, and failure leads to learning.

Perfectionism gets in the way of learning and accomplishing. A blog would help me become more comfortable failing and making mistakes publicly. I want to do more. I want to allow visible imperfection into my life.

### Reducing shame

Shame rules my life.

This emotion is also closely connected to perfectionism for me. I used to hide from others and not share anything about myself out of shame. Things I'm shameful about are often nothing I should be ashamed of rationally.

When I used commute by train, I would sit there in silence for over an hour looking out of the window, just thinking. Because that was all I was comfortable doing. I wouldn't listen to music because sounds might leak out, or do something on my phone because someone might see what I was doing. Weirdest normal things were causing me to be strangely secretive. Almost everything was a cause of shame for me in public, and I only felt at ease in private on my own.

I have come a long way with managing shame, but there are still ways to go. I want to become more comfortable sharing my "shameful" self. A blog is a drastic measure in that regard.

### Challenging indifference

Intense amount of shame and avoidance caused indifference for me.

If you have needs, wants, and desires but can't attain them, one way of coping is indifference. I was growing pretty apathetic to life and had trouble getting interested in most things. As a result, I got bored, spent most of my time distracting myself, and stopped being curious.

It is easier to be apathetic to something you can not get than working through the pain of wanting it.

I’m more balanced now but still struggle with my fair share of apathy and finding curiosity. This blog should help me get more interested and mindful about my interests again.

### Connecting with others

I have been an inactive node in the social graph of society for too long.

Over the last few years, I have met some people that I like and connected with on a more personal level. I was socially deprived for too long, and now is my time to make up for it. I'm more comfortable with myself now, which enables me to talk to others more frequently. Talking to people has become bearable and enjoyable for me, at least more often than not.

Last year especially felt like I was learning exponentially more things because of the connections I made. The learnings would not have been possible on my own. Other people give you a lot of inspirations and insights if you talk to them. On the flip side, you are helping others with their journey.

I want to connect with more people, learn new things, and have new experiences. I want to propagate information to others and receive theirs. A blog will help me become an active node in the social graph.
## Conclusion

There are obviously more reasons I could list such as: improving my writing, building a brand, documenting my life, learning self-expression, getting my thoughts straight, and so on...

A lot of reasons and benefits will reveal themselves in the future. There are a lot of unknowns. I have started placing a lot of weight on the unknown. I can not assess the hidden value of this blog experiment. Only time will tell its value to me.

I’m starting a blog.
